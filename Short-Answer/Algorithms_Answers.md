#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n) because as the input size grows the run time will grow at the same rate.

b)
O(n^2) because there are 2 nested loops and each has O(n).

c)
O(n) because the function is being called recursively.

## Exercise II

O(nlogn) because this follows the logic of a merge sort.

drop an egg at at middle floor to see if it breaks or not

if it breaks move down to the floor at half of the bottom half or if it does not break from the mid point then move up to the the floor at half of the top half. Eliminate halves in the direction the data points towards.

Continue this pattern until there is only one floor left and that will be your answer.
